      At Kiddush Collective, we celebrate the global diversity of Jewish traditions.  is to showcase the many ways that Judaism is practiced across different regions, cultures, and communities, highlighting the beauty and uniqueness of each.

      Judaism is more than a single storyâ€”it is a tapestry of experiences, customs, and voices from around the world. Whether through Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Mizrahi, Ethiopian, or other traditions, the Jewish people have preserved their rich heritage while embracing cultural diversity.

      Through this platform, we aim to connect people with these stories, encouraging understanding and fostering a sense of unity across differences. Dive into the vast array of traditions, learn how Kiddush is said in different regions, and discover how we are all connected through our shared heritage.

      We invite you to explore, share your story, and celebrate with us.
